## Tented High Profile Case for Microdox Keyboard

![case picture](/images/render.png)

Case files are included for left and right cases. Cases can be used with or without tenting.

If you would like tenting, print the tented legs STL for approximately 20 degrees of tenting. Legs can be swapped for others of different heights to achieve different angles. I plan on creating a few variants in the future and uploading them here.

#### Plate:

You have a few options here, you can either purchase the case kit from [Boardsource.xyz](https://boardsource.xyz/store/5f2e7e4a2902de7151494f92) which will provide you with the OLED cover as well, or you can opt for a brass plate.

For the brass plate I went with [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com) and purchased 1.6mm brass plates for $20 ish a plate.
